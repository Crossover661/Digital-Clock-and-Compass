# Digital-Clocks-and-Compasses
Minecraft datapack which allows clocks to show in-game time in digital format, and compasses to show in-game coordinates and compass bearing.

If this datapack is enabled in a world, players holding a clock will see the in-game time and date in the actionbar, and players holding a compass will see their coordinates and compass bearing (i.e. the direction the player is facing, expressed in degrees where 0째 is north, 90째 is east, 180째 is south, and 270째 is west). Players can hold the clock or compass either in the main hand or offhand; when a player is holding both a clock and compass, the item in the main hand takes priority.

By default, clocks show 24-hour time for every player. A player can change their clocks to show 12-hour time using the command "/trigger clockFormat set 1" and revert back to 24-hour time using "/trigger clockFormat set 0". The date displayed by the clock changes at midnight, in line with real-world dates. This means that between midnight and 6 am, the date on the clock is 1 day ahead of the date displayed on the debug screen.

Clocks and compasses will show actionbar displays in all dimensions, providing a way for players in the Nether or End to see the time of day in the Overworld.
